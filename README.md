# Quesadilla

Hi there! This is my personal website. So far I've decided it will be home to my blog and my CV, nothing exceptional here.
It may also be home to some experiments.

This site will have content both in English and Spanish.

## Stack

The site is built using [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), though in the end most of the content will be static.

For the blog I'm planning on using [NimblePublisher](https://https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher), a
little blog engine made by the people at Dashbit. You can learn more about how it works in
[their blog](https://dashbit.co/blog/welcome-to-our-blog-how-it-was-made).
